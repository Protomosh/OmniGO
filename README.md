<h2> About </h2>

### Movement ###
OmniGO is capable of moving in any direction thanks to its wheels that are equipped with rollers in 45° angle.

Implemented controlling algorithm allows us to control its movement with 2 joystick in any direction with and without changing robots physical heading.

### Wireless control ###

For wireless control we are using ESP-NOW protocol that is developed by Espressif. It allows direct P2P communication between Esp32s without need of a access point.

### Visual effects ###

Platform has individually addressable WS2812 LED strip installed on the bottom. These LEDs can be programmed so play animations and such. OmniGO has couple of animations implemented to give visual feedback. Such as Error-mode and Speed-mode.
